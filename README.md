# parrlib
C++/OpenGL wrapper developed by a student as a hobby

parrlib is a (kind-of) wrapper around most of the primary OpenGL functions, it is not complete by any means and probably somewhere (or everywhere) i'm doing things wrong;
i've been developing this wrapper since about 2015 with semi-long breaks inbetween years, it kind of grew itself as i kept on learning new functions to include in it

parrlib is currently provided as a Visual Studio (2019) solution, in the future i plan to convert it to multi-platform but right now if you want to compile it on another OS, youll'have to delve into the code yourself and make changes accordingly.

currently documentation is pretty much non-existent (i only wrote comments when i felt like it), i'll try to document more functions in the future
